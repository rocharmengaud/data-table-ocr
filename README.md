This component needs data to work.

Here is an example of what the data prop is waiting for :

const data = [
{
firstName: 'John',
lastName: 'Doe',
dateOfBirth: '06-10-10',
startDate: '01-22-2022',
street: '20, Test street',
city: 'Testcity',
state: 'Alabama',
zipcode: '15000',
department: 'Sales',
},
];
