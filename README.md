# Basic employees data table

## How to setup the component

This component needs data to work.
You will need to add the prop "data={}" to your component and fill the object.
You will also need to use certain keys.
Here is a full example of what the prop is waiting for with each key:

```js
const data = [
  {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    dateOfBirth: '06-10-92',
    startDate: '01-22-2023',
    street: '20, Test street',
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'Manhattan',
    zipcode: '10451',
    department: 'Marketing',
  },
];
```
